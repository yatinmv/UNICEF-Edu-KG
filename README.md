# UNICEF-Edu-KG

EduKG is a project focused on building knowledge graphs from education data. The project was developed as part of a Knowledge and Data Engineering (KDE) module and uses data provided by UNICEF.

# Overview
The goal of EduKG is to build a knowledge graph that captures key information about education outcomes in various countries. To achieve this, we used an ontology-based approach to model the data and wrote SPARQL queries to extract insights from the knowledge graph.

The data used in this project includes information on completion rates, out-of-school rates, and other education-related metrics. By creating a knowledge graph, we aim to provide a more comprehensive view of the education landscape and enable more informed decision-making.

# Repository Structure

The EduKG repository contains the following directories:

- Application Interface Code: Contains code for the user interface of the EduKG application.
- Ontology: Contains the OWL ontology used to model the education data.
- Original and Uplifted Datasets: Contains the input data files used to build the knowledge graph, as well as any uplifted datasets that were created.
- R2RML Mapping Code: Contains code for the R2RML mapping used to transform the input data into RDF.
- Widico Documentation: Contains documentation for the Widoco tool used to generate HTML documentation for the ontology.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank UNICEF for providing the education data used in this project, as well as our KDE instructor for guiding us through the project development process.
